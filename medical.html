        <h2>MEDICAL & ACCIDENT INSURANCE</h2>

         Medical insurance, also known as health insurance, is a type of insurance that provides coverage for medical expenses and healthcare services. It helps policyholders manage the costs associated with medical treatments, doctor visits, hospital stays, prescription medications, and preventive care. Medical insurance can be obtained through various sources, 
            including employer-sponsored plans, government programs (e.g. NHIF ), or individual policies.<br><BR>

        <b>Premiums:</b> Policyholders pay regular premiums to maintain their medical insurance coverage. The premium amount is determined based on factors such as age, Family size, coverage level, and the insurer's terms.
        <br><br>
        <b>Co-payments:</b> A fixed amount paid by the insured out of pocket for each healthcare service.
        <br><br>
        <b>In-Network and Out-of-Network Providers:</b> Medical insurance plans often have a network of healthcare providers, and using in-network providers typically results in lower out-of-pocket costs. Out-of-network providers may have higher costs or limited coverage.
        <br><br>
        <b>Preventive Care:</b> Many medical insurance plans cover preventive services, such as vaccinations, screenings, and wellness check-ups, without requiring the insured to meet their co-payment.
        <br><br>
        <b>Prescription Drug Coverage:</b> Some medical insurance plans include coverage for prescription medications, either as a separate benefit or as part of the overall coverage.
        <br><br>
        <b>Accident Insurance:</b><br>
        Accident insurance, also known as personal accident insurance, is a type of insurance that provides financial protection to individuals in the event of accidental injuries or death. It is designed to complement medical insurance and offer additional coverage for accidents specifically.<br><br>
        Key features and aspects of accident insurance include:
        <br>
        <b>Coverage for Accidental Injuries:</b> Accident insurance provides coverage for injuries sustained due to accidents, such as slips, falls, burns, fractures, or other accidental events.
        <br><br>
        <b>Lump-Sum Payouts:</b> In the event of a covered accident resulting in injuries, the insured receives a pre-determined lump-sum payment, regardless of the actual medical expenses incurred.
        <br><br>
        <b>No Health Questions or Exams:</b> Accident insurance typically requires no medical underwriting or health exams for enrollment. It is available to individuals of all ages.
        <br><br>
        <b>Covers a Range of Accidents:</b> Accident insurance covers various types of accidents, including those occurring at home, work, during sports or recreational activities, and while traveling.
        <br><br>
        <b>No Restriction on Provider Networks:</b> Unlike medical insurance, accident insurance does not have restrictions on using specific healthcare providers. The insured can receive care from any licensed medical provider.
        <br><br>
        It is essential to understand the specific coverage and limitations of both medical and accident insurance policies. Medical insurance covers a wide range of healthcare services, while accident insurance provides financial support in the case of accidental injuries. For comprehensive protection, individuals may consider having both types of insurance to address various healthcare and accident-related risks effectively.<br>
